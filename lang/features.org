* Polymorphic Variants


  There are three different kinds of variants /[< ... ], [...], [> ...]/.
  They are subtly different in terms of =unification= and =coercion=.
  First, let's consider the cases coercion happens, there are nine cases
  together

** Coercion

*** Co-Domain is closed variant type
    The output is as follows:


    #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
      let f x = (x : [`a] :> [<`a|`b]);;
      val f : [ `a ] -> [ `a ] = <fun>
      
      let f x = (x : [>`a] :> [<`a|`b]);;
      val f : ([< `a | `b > `a ] as 'a) -> 'a = <fun>
      
      let f x = (x : [<`a] :> [< `a|`b]);;
      val f : ([< `a ] as 'a) -> 'a = <fun>
    #+END_SRC

    When the codomain of type coercion is a =closed variant type= ,
    the coercion does not have effect on domain, it may add more
    constraint to the typing relation, but the input and output always
    =share the same type=.

    Here =[< `a | `b > `a ]= reads a subset of =`a= or =`b= with the
    constraint => `a= (this is called =possible tags=)

*** Co-domain is exact variant type

    #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
      let f x = (x : [`a] :> [ `a|`b]);;
      val f : [ `a ] -> [ `a | `b ] = <fun>
      
      let f x = (x : [<`a] :> [ `a|`b]);;
      val f : [< `a ] -> [ `a | `b ] = <fun>
      
      let f x = (x : [> `a] :> [ `a|`b]);;
      val f : [ `a | `b ] -> [ `a | `b ] = <fun>  
    #+END_SRC

    There's no surprise here.
*** Co-domain is open variant type

    #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
      let f x = (x : [ `a] :> [> `a|`b]);;
      val f : [ `a ] -> [> `a | `b ] = <fun>
      
      let f x = (x : [> `a] :> [> `a|`b]);;
      val f : ([> `a | `b ] as 'a) -> 'a = <fun>
      
      let f x = (x : [< `a] :> [> `a|`b]);;
      val f : [< `a ] -> [> `a | `b ] = <fun>
    #+END_SRC

*** Width and depth subtyping
    ocaml does has width and depth subtyping
    if =/t1 :> t1'/= and =/t2 :> t2'/= then =/(t1,t2) :> (t1',t2')/=

    #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
      let f x = (x:[`A] * [`B] :> [`A|`C] * [`B | `D]);; 
      val f : [ `A ] * [ `B ] -> [ `A | `C ] * [ `B | `D ] = <fun>
      
      
      let f x = (x : [ `A | `B ] -> [ `C ] :> [ `A ] -> [ `C | `D ]);;
      val f : ([ `A | `B ] -> [ `C ]) -> [ `A ] -> [ `C | `D ] = <fun>
          
    #+END_SRC

** Unification
   There's some uncertainity in closed variant and open variant. So
   unification will make sense here.

   For example, the code below will give an error

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     let f (x: [` a  ]) : [`a | `b ] = x  (* failed*)   
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     let f (x: [` a  ]) : [< `a | `b ] = x ;;
     val f : [ `a ] -> [ `a ] = <fun>
     
     let f (x:[<`a|`b>`a `b]) :[`a |`b]= x ;;
     (*just abbreviation *)  
     val f : [ `a | `b ] -> [ `a | `b ] = <fun>
                                                
     
     let f (x:[<`a|`b>`a ]) :[`a |`b]= x ;;
     val f : [ `a | `b ] -> [ `a | `b ] = <fun>
     (* the left reads at least allows tag `a *)                                           
     
     let f (x:[<`a|`b>`b ]) :[`a |`b]= x ;;
     val f : [ `a | `b ] -> [ `a | `b ] = <fun>
     (* the left reads at least allows tag `b *)                                           
     
                                                
     let f (x:[<`a|`b>`a `b `c ]) :[`a |`b]= x ;;
     Characters 9-27:
       let f (x:[<`a|`b>`a `b `c ]) :[`a |`b]= x ;;
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     Error: The present constructor c has no type
     
     let f (x:[<`a|`b>`b  ]) :[`a ]= x ;;
     Characters 32-33:
       let f (x:[<`a|`b>`b  ]) :[`a ]= x ;;
                                       ^
     Error: This expression has type [< `a | `b > `b ]
            but an expression was expected of type [ `a ]
            The second variant type does not allow tag(s) `b
     (* the left reads at least allows tag `b while
        the right does not have *)                                    
     
     let f (x:[<`a|`b>`a  ]) :[`a ]= x ;;
     val f : [ `a ] -> [ `a ] = <fun>
     
   #+END_SRC

   There's some varity in closed variant, so the compiler will try to
   unify it.

   Let's take a concrete example:
   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     let f x  =  (x: [> `a] :> [< `a | `b ]);;
     val f : ([< `a | `b > `a ] as 'a) -> 'a = <fun>
   #+END_SRC

   The type of =f= reads that it can be either =`a= or =`b= with a
   constraint that at least allows tag =`a=, so if you tried =f `a=,
   =f `b=, both will work but the following code will
   break:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     let x = (`b : [`b]);;
     val x : [ `b ] = `b
     # f x;;
     Characters 2-3:
       f x;;
         ^
     Error: This expression has type [ `b ] but an expression was expected of type
              [< `a | `b > `a ]
            The first variant type does not allow tag(s) `a
   #+END_SRC

** Example


   The code below shows how to define type abbreviations to reduce type
   coercion:

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     type value = [`Scalar of float | `Vector of float * float ]
     type scalar = [`Scalar of float]
     type vector = [`Vector of float * float ]
     type operation =
         [`Multiply of scalar * scalar
         | `DotProduct of vector * vector ]
     type general_operation =
         [ `Multiply of value * value 
         | `DotProduct of value * value ]
     let values x =
       match (x : operation :> general_operation)  with
       | `Multiply (a,b) ->  [a;b]
       | `DotProduct (a,b) -> [a;b]      
   #+END_SRC

*** Problem
    The type inference was not precise:

    #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
      let f x = match x  with `a -> `b | x -> x ;;
      val f : ([> `a | `b ] as 'a) -> 'a = <fun>
    #+END_SRC

    Here the =`a= will never appear as output, but we could not encode
    the invariant here.


*** use-case

    If the variant type is exported in the interface and I feel that
    some cases could appear in other modules but it wouldn't
    necessarily make sense to make them dependend on the module, I use
    polymorphic variants because they are *not tied* to the module
    namespace system

    If the variant type is exported in the interface I find it
    sometimes too verbose to use regular variants when values of the
    variant type are given to functions of the module.

    
    # (LA,RA,NA) and position, token stream

    #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
      type base = [`String of string | `Int of int]
      type t1 = [base | `Bool of bool | `List of t1 list]
      type t2 = [base | `Other]
      
      let simplify (x:t1):t2 = match x with
      | #base as b -> b
      | `Bool _ | `List _ -> `Other    
    #+END_SRC

*** open recursion for term rewriting

    #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
      type base = [`String of string | `Int of int]
      type t1 = [base | `Bool of bool | `List of t1 list]
      type t2 = [base | `Other]
                  
      let simplify (x:t1):t2 = match x with
        | #base as b -> b
        | `Bool _ | `List _ -> `Other    
    #+END_SRC

    Unfortunately Ocaml's Hindley-Milner type inference is not strong
    enough to do this kind of thing without explicit typing, which
    requires careful factorisation of the types, which in turn makes
    proto-typing difficult. Additionally, explicit coercions are
    sometimes required.

    The big downside of this technique is that for terms with multiple
    parameters, one soon ends up with a rather confusing combinatorial
    explosion of types, and in the end it is easier to give up on
    static enforcement and use a kitchen sink type with wildcards and
    exceptions (i.e. dynamic typing).


** type abbreviation

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     type 'a number = 'a constraint 'a = [>`Integer of int | `Real of float]
   #+END_SRC

   It's cool that ~'a~ can be extended dynamically

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     let zero : 'a number = `Zero;;
     val zero : [> `Integer of int | `Real of float | `Zero ] number = `Zero
     
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     type 'a number = 'a constraint 'a = [< `Integer of int | `Real of float ]
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
   let z:'a number  = `Real 3.0;;
   val z : [< `Integer of int | `Real of float > `Real ] number = `Real 3.
   #+END_SRC


   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     type number = [ `Integer of int | `Real of float ]   
   #+END_SRC
   

** private row types
   Private row types are type abbreviations where part of the
   structure of the type is left abstract.

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     type-equation   ::=      ...  
             âˆ£        = private typexpr
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Concretely =typexpr= in the above should denote either an object
   type or a polymorphic variant type. If the private declaration is
   used in interface, the corresponding implementation may either
   provide a ground instance, or a refined private type.

   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
   type c = private <x:int; ..> 
   #+END_SRC

   This denotation does more than hiding the =y= method, it also makes
   the type =c= *incompatible* with any other *closed* object type.


   Private row types are more flexible with respect to incremental
   refinement, this feature can be used in combination with
   functors. (* FIXME subtyping does not work here :-(, refinement works*)
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
     module F(X : sig type c = private < x : int; .. > end) = struct
       let get_x (o : X.c) = o#x end
     module G(X : sig type c = private < x : int; y : int; .. > end) = struct
       include F(X)
       let get_y (o : X.c) = o#y end;;
     
     module F : functor (X : sig type c = private < x : int; .. > end) ->
         sig val get_x : X.c -> int end
     module G : functor (X : sig type c = private < x : int; y : int; .. > end) ->
         sig val get_x : X.c -> int val get_y : X.c -> int end
        
   #+END_SRC

*** combination with polymorphic variant
    #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
      type t = [ `A of int | `B of bool ]
      type u = private [< t > `A ]
      type v = private [> t ]
    #+END_SRC
    With type =u=, it's possible to create values of the form (`A n),
    but not (`B b), with type =v=, construction is restricted to
    =`A,`B=, and a default case is *needed*
    
    
** Conculsion

   For open union, it's easy to reuse, but *unsafe*, for closed union,
   hard to use, since the type checker is conservative



* Variance notation

  If you don't write the =+= and =-=, ocaml will =infer= them for you
  , but when you write *abstract type* in module type signatures, it
  makes sense.  variance annotations =allow you to expose the
  subtyping properties= of your type in an interface, without exposing
  the representation.

  #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
    type (+'a, +'b) t = 'a * 'b
    type (-'a,+'b) t = 'a -> 'b 
    module M : sig
      type (+'a,'+b) t
    end = struct
      type ('a,'b) t = 'a * 'b 
    end
  #+END_SRC

  ocaml did the check when you define it, so you can not define it
  arbitrarily

  Variance notation helps polymorphism

  #+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
    module M : sig
      type +'a t
      val embed : 'a -> 'a t
    end = struct
      type 'a t = 'a
      let embed x = x
    end ;;
    M.embed []  ;;
    - : 'a list M.t = <abstr>
  #+END_SRC
  You can see that it's no longer =/'_a list/=
